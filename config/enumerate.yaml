Enumerate:

  General:
    #contig_dir, read_dir, and gtf_dir only need to be set if running the enumerate step alone
    #these set the directories containing the contig fastas, read files and annotation gtfs
    contig_dir: ""
    #set the expected extension after the file name for contigs
    #again only required if running the enumeration step alone
    contig_ext: ""
    gtf_dir: ""
    #features to count from the taxonomic and functional annotations
    feature_list: "kingdom,phylum,class,order,family,genus,species,Predicted_protein_name"
    #features to count combined eg. species + predicted gene name will count genes split by species
    #provide as comma seperated list with pairs split by colons
    feature_pairs: "Predicted_protein_name:species,Predicted_protein_name:genus"
    #Use multimethod to handle counts when a gene is mapped to multiple annotations of a feature
    #for instance a gene annotated with multiple GO terms.
    #"whole" will add the whole gene count to every annotation, "split" will divide the count across the features
    #it is instead recommended to count unique features (e.g. predicted protein name) and use gmt_pairs in the annotation stage to make files for set enrichment
    multimethod: "split"
